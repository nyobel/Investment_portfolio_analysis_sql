# Investment_portfolio_analysis_sql

This project is built to simulate data handling and analysis for an investment company. It uses **SQL** within **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to explore and manage datasets related to clients, portfolios, investments, and transactions.

The data is **AI-generated** and designed to reflect realistic financial structures and business logic. It enables practice in areas such as data cleaning, transformation, and performance analysis.

üìê The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to structure the data workflow:
- **Bronze** for raw ingested data  
- **Silver** for cleaned and joined datasets  
- **Gold** for final analysis-ready views

---

## üî∞ Bronze Layer (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)

- Created five tables under the `bronze` schema: `clients`, `portfolios`, `investments`, `portfolio_performance`, and `transactions`.
- Data was loaded from CSV files.
- `clients` and `portfolios` were ingested via `BULK INSERT` using a stored procedure `bronze.load_bronze`.
- Due to decimal compatibility issues with SQL Server Express/Developer editions:
  - `investments`, `portfolio_performance`, and `transactions` were imported using **Flat File Import Wizard**.
- All DDL scripts and the load procedure are included and documented in the `/scripts/bronze` folder.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Silver Layer (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)

- Created cleaned versions of the Bronze tables under the `silver` schema.
- Built a stored procedure `silver.load_silver` that:
  - **Deletes existing records** in the correct referential order (child ‚Üí parent) to avoid FK conflicts.
  - **Inserts cleaned data** with logic applied such as:
    - Trimming whitespace
    - Replacing invalid values (e.g., negative amounts or underage clients)
    - Standardizing `transaction_type` entries
    - Creating derived fields like `age_group`
- Maintains foreign key constraints between related tables to preserve integrity.
- Logging and error handling is built into the procedure using `TRY...CATCH` and `PRINT` statements.
- All scripts are available in the `/scripts/silver` folder.

## üõ£Ô∏è Next Steps

The Gold layer will focus on:

- Designing **business-focused views** for executive analysis
- Calculating **KPIs** such as portfolio growth, client activity, and risk exposure
- Laying the groundwork for possible **Power BI** or **Tableau** integration

This structure supports traceability and scalability while mimicking how modern data systems are organized in practice. The project will grow over time with additional logic, insights, and possibly dashboards.
