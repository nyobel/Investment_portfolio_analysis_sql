# Investment_portfolio_analysis_sql

This project is built to simulate data handling and analysis for an investment company. It uses **SQL** within **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to explore and manage datasets related to clients, portfolios, investments, and transactions.

The data is **AI-generated** and designed to reflect realistic financial structures and business logic. It enables practice in areas such as data cleaning, transformation, and performance analysis.

üèóÔ∏è The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to structure the data workflow:
- **Bronze** for raw ingested data  
- **Silver** for cleaned and joined datasets  
- **Gold** for final analysis-ready views

## üî∞ Bronze Layer (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)

- Created five tables under the `bronze` schema: `clients`, `portfolios`, `investments`, `portfolio_performance`, and `transactions`.
- Data was loaded from CSV files.
- `clients` and `portfolios` were ingested via `BULK INSERT` using a stored procedure `bronze.load_bronze`.
- Due to decimal compatibility issues with SQL Server Express/Developer editions:
  - `investments`, `portfolio_performance`, and `transactions` were imported using **Flat File Import Wizard**.
- All DDL scripts and the load procedure are included and documented in the `/scripts/bronze` folder.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Silver Layer (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)

- Created cleaned versions of the Bronze tables under the `silver` schema.
- Built a stored procedure `silver.load_silver` that:
  - **Deletes existing records** in the correct referential order (child ‚Üí parent) to avoid FK conflicts.
  - **Inserts cleaned data** with logic applied such as:
    - Trimming whitespace
    - Replacing invalid values (e.g., negative amounts or underage clients)
    - Standardizing `transaction_type` entries
    - Creating derived fields like `age_group`
- Maintains foreign key constraints between related tables to preserve integrity.
- Logging and error handling is built into the procedure using `TRY...CATCH` and `PRINT` statements.
- All scripts are available in the `/scripts/silver` folder.

## ‚ú® Gold Layer (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)

- Constructed **star schema views** under the `gold` schema:
  - **Fact Views**: `fact_investments`, `fact_transactions`, `fact_portfolio_performance`
  - **Dimension Views**: `dim_clients`, `dim_portfolios`
- Enriched the data with:
  - Surrogate keys using `ROW_NUMBER()`
  - Business metrics such as `performance_diff`, `return_ratio`, and `benchmark_flag`
  - Derived fields like `onboard_year` and `onboard_month`
- All transformations are fully handled within SQL views, making the data analytics-ready and logically structured for BI tools.
- All scripts are available in the `/scripts/gold` folder.

---

## üìä Next Steps

- Build **Power BI dashboards** using the Gold views.
- Visualize and analyze trends across:
  - Investment amounts by region, age group, or portfolio type
  - Client activity and transaction patterns
  - Portfolio performance versus benchmark over time
- Answer **key stakeholder questions** with dynamic KPIs, filters, and time-series visualizations.

This structure supports traceability and scalability while mimicking how modern data systems are organized in practice. The project will grow over time with additional logic, insights, and possibly dashboards.
