# Investment_portfolio_analysis_sql

This project is built to simulate data handling and analysis for an investment company. It uses **SQL** within **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to explore and manage datasets related to clients, portfolios, investments, and transactions.

The data is **AI-generated** and designed to reflect realistic financial structures and business logic. It enables practice in areas such as data cleaning, transformation, and performance analysis.

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to structure the data workflow:
- **Bronze** for raw ingested data  
- **Silver** for cleaned and joined datasets  
- **Gold** for final analysis-ready views

This structure supports traceability and scalability while mimicking how modern data systems are organized in practice. The project will grow over time with additional logic, insights, and possibly dashboards.
