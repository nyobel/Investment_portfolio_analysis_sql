# Investment_portfolio_analysis_sql

This project is built to simulate data handling and analysis for an investment company. It uses **SQL** within **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to explore and manage datasets related to clients, portfolios, investments, and transactions.

The data is **AI-generated** and designed to reflect realistic financial structures and business logic. It enables practice in areas such as data cleaning, transformation, and performance analysis.

üìê The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to structure the data workflow:
- **Bronze** for raw ingested data  
- **Silver** for cleaned and joined datasets  
- **Gold** for final analysis-ready views

## üî∞ Bronze Layer (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)

- Created five tables under the `bronze` schema: `clients`, `portfolios`, `investments`, `portfolio_performance`, and `transactions`.
- Data was loaded from CSV files.
- `clients` and `portfolios` were ingested via `BULK INSERT` using a stored procedure `bronze.load_bronze`.
- Due to decimal compatibility issues with SQL Server Express/Developer editions:
  - `investments`, `portfolio_performance`, and `transactions` were imported using **Flat File Import Wizard**.
- All DDL scripts and the load procedure are included and documented in the `/scripts/bronze` folder.

## üõ£Ô∏è Next Steps

The Silver and Gold layers will follow:

- **Silver Layer**: Apply transformations, enforce constraints, join logic, and derive analytical columns.
- **Gold Layer**: Design business-focused views, KPIs, and potential dashboard integrations.

This structure supports traceability and scalability while mimicking how modern data systems are organized in practice. The project will grow over time with additional logic, insights, and possibly dashboards.
